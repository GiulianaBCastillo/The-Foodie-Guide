# The Foodie Guide

We created this project as a tool to search for the best recipes based on my craving. What makes us different is that here you can find nutritional information and recipes based on one particual item or a whole meal. On top of that, you can search for a random meal if you do not know what you want, a video on how to make that meal will also be available to the user.
