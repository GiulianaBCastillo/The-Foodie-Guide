# The Foodie Guide

We created this project as a tool to search for the best recipes based on my craving. What makes us different is that here you can find nutritional information and recipes based on one particual item ( bread for example) or a whole meak (Pasta alla Gricia for exmample). On top of that, you can search for a random meal if you do not know what you want, a video on how to make that meal will also be avaible to the user.

# Usage
Simply fill in the food or ingredient you are craving in the search bar and a list of the best recipes will appear, with calorie counts per recipe. There will be a 2nd feature allowing to request a random recipe, this feature also comes with a video suggestion on how to make the recipe.
